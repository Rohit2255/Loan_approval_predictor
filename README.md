# Loan Approval Predictor

This is my Day 1 project for the 100 Days of Finance Data Science challenge.

## Goal

To predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on customer data like income, loan amount, credit history, etc.

## What I did

- Loaded and cleaned the data
- Did EDA using Plotly (interactive graphs)
- Handled missing values
- Converted categorical data into numbers
- Scaled the features
- Built a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated the model using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Dataset

Used the Loan Prediction dataset from Kaggle:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset

## Accuracy

My model gave around **79% accuracy** on validation data.
